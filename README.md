# AldiB-N-B

For a school project, we have created "Aldib'n'b" in wordpress.
Aldib'n'b allows the host to publish some post in which they propose their own properties. They can add a title to their announce, add one or multiple pictures, choose the type of location (ex : apartment, villa, house, ...), the price of a night, and precise more information. They can also add a description to their publication to inform as much as possible the client.
The users of aldib'n'b can choose the destination, the length of their stay, how much they will be for the trip and can even filter their research.
Once they do a research, a list will be shown with every filter you have asked : u'll see the name, filters, description, price and the popularity.
When u click an announce, the user will have all the information of it...
If they are attracted by it, they can book it without worry about the security (V2, not in prod)
Aldib'n'b also suggest a mstery destination for the users who doesnt know where to go or for those who wants to discover a new destination randomly. (V2, not in prod)
